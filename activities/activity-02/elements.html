   <p>Morning light <em>slipped through the window,</em> turning ordinary moments into 
    something <strong>gentle</strong> and new. <br><br> With each quiet breath, the day felt full of small 
    possibilities—unfinished tasks,<mark> conversations, and chances to begin again</mark>.<br><br>
    Sometimes it's in these simple starts that the most meaningful progress quietly takes shape.</p>
